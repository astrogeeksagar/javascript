## Introduction

LeetCode is a popular online platform that offers a vast collection of coding interview questions. This repository serves as a compilation of my JavaScript solutions to these LeetCode problems. Each solution is organized in its own directory, named after the problem title, and contains the JavaScript file with the implementation.

## Problem List

- [Problem 1](./Create%20Hello%20World%20Function.html): Write a function createHelloWorld. It should return a new function that always returns "Hello World".
- [Problem 2](./Counter.html): Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc)
- [Problem 3](./tobeornottobe.html): Write a function expect that helps developers test their code. It should take in any value val and return an object with the following two functions.
toBe(val) accepts another value and returns true if the two values === each other. If they are not equal, it should throw an error "Not Equal".
notToBe(val) accepts another value and returns true if the two values !== each other. If they are equal, it should throw an error "Equal".
  ...

Add more problem sections as needed.
